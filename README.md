# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Mission 5 

The purpose of this mission is to create a web appication where I designed a Web page that consist of a search result assuming that a user has searched for a property and will reveal the outcome of the displayed filtered houses that matches the criteria. I mainly used Javascript, React and also css to create app but I also do the backend where I created the database that connects to mongoDB and I used Mongo Atlas to create the database and have inserted the document in my database coming from my mongodb dashboard where I have created the property deatails of the filtered houses. 

## Running with Docker
So in this mission, I have used docker files and I have two docker files in each of the directory where one is frontend and the other is backend. and also I have docker-compose yaml file that is used to read through both of the directories and ensures that they run through the container when compiling them. In order to run this application, you must start a new terminal and you should directed to a root folder and when you are in the root folder, you enter this command "docker-compose up" and it may take a long time to wait but once it is completed, you must have the docker desktop and open the container that has been named and you would need to check if they are running and when they are running, you can enter the localhost:3000 in any browser you prefer and the application should open
